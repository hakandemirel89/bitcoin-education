## Web Dashboard MVP - Plan
_2026-02-12_

**Goal:** Add a lightweight local web dashboard (Flask) to the btcedu project, alongside a project journal utility for tracking development progress across sessions.

**Architecture decisions:**
- Flask chosen over FastAPI: no async needed, built-in Jinja2, lighter on Raspberry Pi
- Single-page dashboard with vanilla JS (no build step, no framework)
- API blueprint pattern for clean separation of routes
- Reuses existing pipeline functions directly (no subprocess calls)
- Journal utility with secret redaction for safe append-only logging

**Deliverables:**
1. `btcedu/utils/journal.py` - Progress log utility with secret redaction
2. `btcedu/web/app.py` - Flask app factory
3. `btcedu/web/api.py` - REST API (13 endpoints)
4. `btcedu/web/templates/index.html` - Dashboard HTML
5. `btcedu/web/static/app.js` - Vanilla JS frontend
6. `btcedu/web/static/styles.css` - Dark theme CSS
7. `tests/test_journal.py` - 14 tests for journal utility
8. `tests/test_web.py` - 23 tests for web API
9. CLI commands: `btcedu web`, `btcedu journal`

## How to Resume

To continue development in a new Claude session, provide this context:

```
Project: /home/pi/AI-Startup-Lab/bitcoin-education
See docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md for what's been built so far.
The web dashboard MVP is complete with 172 passing tests.
Key files: btcedu/web/app.py, btcedu/web/api.py, btcedu/web/static/app.js
Run: btcedu web --host 0.0.0.0
Tests: python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Next steps (not yet implemented):**
- Auto-refresh polling (optional timer in JS)
- Episode selection via URL params
- Bulk actions (run-pending from UI)
- WebSocket for live pipeline progress

## Public Dashboard Deployment - Plan & Implementation
_2026-02-12_

**Goal:** Expose the btcedu web dashboard publicly at https://lnodebtc.duckdns.org/dashboard/
with basic auth, HTTPS, and production-grade serving.

**Key discovery:** Caddy v2.6.2 already runs on the Pi with auto-TLS for lnodebtc.duckdns.org.
No need for nginx or certbot.

**Architecture:**
```
Internet → DuckDNS → Router → Caddy (:443, auto-TLS) → Gunicorn (:8090)
```

**Files created:**
- `deploy/btcedu-web.service` - systemd unit for gunicorn (2 workers, 300s timeout, localhost-only)
- `deploy/Caddyfile.dashboard` - Caddy config snippet with basic_auth + security headers
- `deploy/setup-web.sh` - Deployment helper script

**Files modified:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Added gunicorn to [web] deps
- `btcedu/cli.py` - Added `--production` flag to `btcedu web` command
- `README.md` - Added "Public Dashboard Deployment" section

**Security measures:**
- Gunicorn binds to 127.0.0.1 only
- Caddy basic_auth with bcrypt password
- Security headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy
- Auto-renewing TLS via Caddy/Let's Encrypt
- No secrets exposed to frontend

**Deployment steps:**
```bash
.venv/bin/pip install 'gunicorn>=22.0.0'
sudo cp deploy/btcedu-web.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now btcedu-web
# Then update /etc/caddy/Caddyfile with handle_path /dashboard/* block
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

## Dashboard Fix: Reverse Proxy URL Routing
_2026-02-12_

**Problem:** Dashboard at `https://lnodebtc.duckdns.org/dashboard/` loaded HTML but was completely non-functional — episode list stuck on "Loading...", all buttons broken.

**Root cause:** Absolute URL paths in HTML and JS conflicted with Caddy's route matching:
- `<link href="/static/styles.css">` → served by btc-dashboard file_server (wrong app)
- `<script src="/static/app.js">` → served by btc-dashboard file_server (wrong app)
- `fetch("/api/episodes")` → routed to btc-dashboard API on :9000 (wrong backend)

Only the initial `/dashboard/` request matched Caddy's `@dashboard path /dashboard/*` matcher. All subsequent absolute-path requests bypassed it.

**Fix:**
1. Changed HTML paths from absolute to relative: `href="static/styles.css"`, `src="static/app.js"`
2. Changed JS fetch from `fetch("/api" + path)` to `fetch("api" + path)` (relative)
3. Added `redir /dashboard /dashboard/ permanent` in Caddy for trailing slash
4. Added `GET /api/health` endpoint for monitoring
5. Added error handling in JS: try/catch on refresh(), error banner in table, toast on API failure
6. Added 5 new tests: health endpoint, relative paths verification, static asset serving, JS path check

**Files modified:**
- `btcedu/web/templates/index.html` - Relative static paths
- `btcedu/web/static/app.js` - Relative API paths + error handling
- `btcedu/web/api.py` - Health endpoint
- `deploy/Caddyfile.dashboard` - Trailing slash redirect
- `tests/test_web.py` - 5 new tests (28 total)

**Test results:** 177 tests passing (172 existing + 5 new)

**Verification:** All routes confirmed working through Caddy proxy (health, episodes API, static assets, redirect).

## Background Job Execution for Dashboard Actions
_2026-02-12_

**Problem:** Dashboard pipeline actions (download, transcribe, chunk, generate, run, retry) were synchronous — the browser fetch blocked for 2-30+ minutes with no progress indicator, frequently timing out via Caddy/gunicorn. No logging to diagnose issues.

**Solution:** Non-blocking 202 pattern with background thread execution and real-time polling.

**Architecture:**
```
gunicorn (-w 1 --threads 4 gthread)
├── Threads 1-4: Flask request handlers
│     POST /api/episodes/X/transcribe → JobManager.submit() → 202 {job_id}
│     GET /api/jobs/{id} → return job state from memory
└── ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)
      → runs pipeline tasks sequentially (SQLite single-writer safe)
      → updates job.state/stage in-memory
      → appends to data/logs/episodes/{episode_id}.log
```

**Key decisions:**
- `-w 1 --threads 4` instead of `-w 2`: single process = shared in-memory job state, less RAM on Pi
- `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)`: one job at a time (SQLite constraint), tasks queue up
- In-memory jobs: lost on restart, but episode DB status is always the source of truth
- `detect` stays synchronous: fast, global action, user expects immediate feedback

**Files created:**
- `btcedu/web/jobs.py` - Job dataclass + JobManager class (~220 lines)

**Files modified:**
- `btcedu/web/app.py` - JobManager init, request logging to data/logs/web.log
- `btcedu/web/api.py` - 6 endpoints return 202 + job_id, new GET /api/jobs/{id}, GET /api/episodes/{id}/action-log
- `btcedu/web/static/app.js` - submitJob/pollJob pattern, spinner with stage info, Logs tab, auto-refresh
- `btcedu/web/static/styles.css` - spinner-inline, pulse animation, log-viewer, disabled button styles
- `deploy/btcedu-web.service` - Changed to `-w 1 --threads 4`
- `tests/test_web.py` - Updated for 202 responses, added TestJobsAndLogs class (8 tests)

**New API endpoints:**
- GET /api/jobs/{job_id} - Poll job state/stage/result + current episode_status
- GET /api/episodes/{id}/action-log?tail=N - Per-episode log file tail

**Frontend changes:**
- Action buttons return immediately, show inline spinner with stage info
- Buttons disabled while job is active, 409 prevents duplicate submissions
- New "Logs" tab with auto-refresh while job is running
- Toast notifications for job completion/failure with result details

**Test results:** 183 tests passing (177 existing + 6 new/updated)

## Pipeline Semantics: Standardize Run All / Retry Behavior
_2026-02-12_

**Problem:** "Run All" and "Retry" actions had unclear semantics. Web UI `_do_full_pipeline()` reimplemented pipeline logic inline (diverged from CLI). No pipeline plan logging, no tooltips, no documentation. "Run All" didn't clear stale errors.

**Changes:**

1. **`resolve_pipeline_plan()`** — New function in `pipeline.py` that returns a plan (list of stage decisions: run/skip/pending with reasons) without executing anything. Used by both "Run All" and "Retry" to show decisions upfront.

2. **`stage_callback`** — New optional parameter on `run_episode_pipeline()` and `retry_episode()`. Called before each stage runs, enabling real-time progress updates in the web UI (spinner shows current stage).

3. **Unified "Run All"** — `_do_full_pipeline()` now calls `run_episode_pipeline()` + `write_report()` (same as CLI), instead of reimplementing pipeline logic inline. Clears stale `error_message` before running. Returns "Nothing to do" for already-completed episodes.

4. **Enhanced "Retry"** — Now logs the pipeline plan and last error before retrying. Uses `stage_callback` for real-time progress.

5. **UI tooltips** — All 6 action buttons now have `title` attributes explaining what they do.

6. **README documentation** — Added "Pipeline Actions Explained" section documenting detect, download, transcribe, chunk, generate, run-all, and retry with clear semantics.

**Semantic definitions:**
- **Run All**: Runs from earliest incomplete stage. Skips completed stages. Idempotent. Force re-runs all.
- **Retry**: Requires error_message. Clears error, re-runs from current status (last successful stage).

**Files modified:**
- `btcedu/core/pipeline.py` — Added `StagePlan`, `resolve_pipeline_plan()`, `stage_callback` param
- `btcedu/web/jobs.py` — Unified `_do_full_pipeline()` and enhanced `_do_retry()`
- `btcedu/web/static/app.js` — Added tooltips to action buttons
- `tests/test_pipeline.py` — Added `TestResolvePipelinePlan` (7 tests)
- `tests/test_web.py` — Added `test_run_all_nothing_to_do_on_generated`, fixed StaticPool for threading
- `README.md` — Added "Pipeline Actions Explained" section

**Test results:** 191 tests passing (183 existing + 8 new)
